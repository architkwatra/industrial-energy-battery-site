# Industrial Energy Battery Layout mock up

This project lets a user choose from different Industrial Energy Battery options and mocks up a layout for the chosen options in the UI.  
<br />


User can run the server and install the npm modules by executing the command `npm start` in the root directory

This project assumes that you already have node installed on your system. In case you don't have node, you can skip the above command and instead execute the shell script named `start.sh` (It assumes you already have brew installed)<br />

### Note: You might have to set the executable permission for `start.sh` file before you run it. For setting the executable permission, you will need to run the command `chmod +x start.sh` as a root user. <br /><br />

Once you have set the right permission, you can run the `./start.sh`  command in a terminal to install the dependencies and run the server on `localhost:8080`

<br />

For installing the node modules separately, user can run the below command

### `npm install` command installs all the necessary modules needed for the project
<br />

For starting the server individually, user can run use the below command
### `npm start` command runs the server on `localhost:8080`

<br />

Below are a few screenshots showing how the UI looks with different options chosen for the industrial battery
